
# Bing Search Automation

This is a simple python selenium browser automation project, which is solely 
developed for making the process of earning bing reward points easier and 
quicker.

> Disclaimer: This project is still under-developed and works well with the 
> Edge browser only. Will be definitely adding other browser support soon.  
> ***Note**: This project is safe to use and is completely working well.*
